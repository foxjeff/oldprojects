    Namah Shivaya,
    
    We shall meet today in the afternoon at 2:30 pm to discuss on the TCM/G-VIA deployment for PRMC.
    
    Agenda:-
    1)Identifying the location for installation of TCM (Tentatively decided for Kayankulam)
    
    2)How to get the TCM connected to our telematics network ie. either modem,network cable etc.
    
    3)What sort of application will the Station Master be viewing on the TCM?
    
    4)What sort of data would have to be collected for G-VIA around the TCM location?
    
    5)Other issues to be discussed are UPS for TCM, GPRS connectivity issues with modems if used for TCM.
    
    Please make yourself available for the meeting.
    
    Regards
    Ranjith

    We've added two DNS names for our public IP server which is accessible as 192.168.0.233 from internal n/w and 59.145.110.83 from Internet.
    
    DNS names are:
    # itews.amrita.ac.in - for ITEWS use
    # arl.amrita.ac.in - for general use
    
    Also we've added password protection to apache.  Two user ids are present now:
    # userid: arl, password: amriteshwari - for our use
    # userid: prmc, password: wits@amrita -for PRMC
    
    We will get 'Authentication for WITS Domain' dialog box when attempting to open a page/image hosted under this server. We can use 'arl' and 'ammaamma' for our internal use.
    
    Also, http://itews.amrita.ac.in/tids hosts our live TIDS service now.

    h1. Transcript of chat between Dinesh and myself on arrival/departure time computation
    
    dinesh.arl: Are we inserting/updating current_trips table whenever we receive LUP?
    
    
    dinesh.arl: Available at seat
    Jayaraj: in the final implementation IVTU will keep track of previous and current TGATEs seen and thereby will be able to tell when it enters a new hotzone
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    
    
    Jayaraj: In such a case IVTU/ TGATE will be able to send vehicle arrival event to TDCS
    Similarly IVTU will have facility to detect powerdown situations and hence IVTU/TGATE will be able to distinguish between IVTU powerdowns vs departures ...
    and hence will be able to send vehicle departure event to TDCS
    Also the IVTU may be fitted with a smartcard reader
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    
    
    Jayaraj: and whenver vehicle begins a new trip the conductor will place a route card (a smart card containing route-id and node list of the route) at the IVTU
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    
    
    Jayaraj: based on this IVTU can tell TGATE/TDCS which route it's traveling
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    
    
    Jayaraj: of course there are other ways of telling TDCS route info
    one way is for station master to enter the information at a terminal connected to TDCS
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    
    
    Jayaraj: Also, for buses regularly following scheduled trips - this info can be taken from bus_timetable table
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    
    
    Jayaraj: however the static timetable is not wholly reliable even for EXP buses and such because reassignments could happen
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    
    
    Jayaraj: Advantage of route card is that it doesnot involve data entry - making station master enter data may result in reactions ranging from resistance to technology to demanding from us to develop a station-master info system
    
    
    dinesh.arl: yes
    
    
    Jayaraj: however place a card is a non-technical kind of activity
    anyway, to continue..
    
    
    dinesh.arl: true
    
    
    Jayaraj: IVTU can detect change in route-card and send this event to TGATE/TDCS
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    
    
    Jayaraj: Or TDCS when TDCS gets a vehicle departure event for a vehicle with a new route-id it knows vehicle has begun a new trip
    so at this time it can replace current_trip record for the vehicle with the new current-trip record
    
    
    dinesh.arl: which is the vehicle -deaprture event
    ?
    Code for that event
    
    
    Jayaraj: When TGATE stops receiving LUP from an IVTU AND TGATE has not received a powerdown message from IVTU, it generates a vehicle departure event
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    
    
    Jayaraj: similarly when TGATE receives a LUP from an IVTU containing last known tgate code field set to another TGATE's code, it generates a vehicle arrival event
    
    
    dinesh.arl: TDCS never will have to handle LUP msgs then?
    
    
    Jayaraj: Other LUPs, powerdown events are locally handled by TGATE and will not be send to TDCS
    
    
    dinesh.arl: only these arrival & departure events instead?
    
    
    Jayaraj: We can still call the underlying message LUP - however TGATE will 'cook' the messages from IVTU into arrival/departure info before sending them to TDCS
    of course message structure will change
    
    
    dinesh.arl: What's the use of LUP msg handling then at TDCS?
    
    
    Jayaraj: For current PRMC we will not be able to implement this
    
    
    dinesh.arl: oh!
    
    
    Jayaraj: we'll have to stick to our current message structures
    Also, our database schema which I saw will not change for this purpose as well
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    
    
    Jayaraj: But that's after the PRMC
    I just wanted to tell you the final algorithm...
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok fine
    
    
    Jayaraj: the current method is not robust
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    
    
    Jayaraj: for now - i think whenever we get a LUP from TGATE we have (TGATE-CODE, IVTU-CODE, TIMESTAMP)
    
    
    dinesh.arl: yes
    
    
    Jayaraj: route is not cleary known - so we'll have to set route-id to null for now
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    "Cooking" is to be done now at TDCS?
    
    
    Jayaraj: I think TDCS will have to keep a last_lup_table containing (ivtu-id, tgate-id, timestamp)
    yes - TDCS does the cooking for all:)
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok
    
    
    Jayaraj: shall I post a message describing skeletal algorithm?
    
    
    dinesh.arl: Yes, for the current PRMC.
    
    
    Jayaraj: yes
    also - I'll post this chat for reference since it contains some ideas for future implementations
    
    
    dinesh.arl: ok

    Since IVTU/TGATE has no state information the current algorithm can be as follows:
    
    IVTU/TGATE-side:
    
    To distinguish between powerdown and out-of-range situations:
    
    <pre>
    IGNITION-POWER --> RELAY: NORMALLY CLOSED
              |        RELAY: COMMON------->IVTU BOX
         +---- )-----> RELAY: NORMALLY OPEN
         |    |               ^
         |    +------INTR--v  | (RELAY TRIGGER) 
    BATTERY-POWER ------->   PIC
    </pre>
    
    Tu = time interval of LUPs from IVTU before it gets LAK from TGATE. Typical value 3 seconds
    Tl = time interval of LUPs from IVTU after it got LAK from TGATE. Typical value 10 seconds
    Npwdn = typical value 3
    Mpwdn = typical value 5
    Tassoc = association time typical value 5 seconds
    When PIC detects ignition off it waits for Npwdn*Tl seconds, switches the relay to battery power, waits for (Mpwdn*Tu+Tassoc) seconds, switches the relay back and goes to power down mode.
    
    TGATE-side:
    
    Change LUP format to:
    <code>
    LUP T001 V001 <SEQNUM> <LF> <TIMESTAMP>, V002 <SEQNUM> <LF> <TIMESTAMP>
    <LF>: Location Flag
    </code>
    
    TDCS maintains last-lup-table with entries:
    (LAST-LUP-IVTU, LAST-LUP-TDCS-TIME, LAST-LUP-TGATE-TIME, LAST-LUP-SEQNUM, LAST-LUP-LF)
    
    On LUP (LUP-IVTU, LUP-TGATE-TIME, LUP-TIME, LUP-SEQNUM, LUP-LF) at TDCS
    
    <code>
    if ( (LUP-SEQNUM less than LAST-LUP-SEQNUM) AND (LUP-TGATE-TIME - LAST-LUP-TGATE-TIME) IS NEARLY SAME AS (Tu*Npwdn + Tassoc+Tu*LUP-SEQNUM) )
    BEGIN
      GENERATE power-down event for IVTU
      SET IVTU power status to down
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN

    Aum Amriteswaryai Namah.
    
    Shall we meet as early as possible to discuss and plan for a dry run for the PRMC.  We'll try to make our presentations/demos in the dry-run as close as possible to the actual PRMC.  Early next week (Monday/Tuesday) would be good.
    
    We can invite other technically exprienced colleagues from our campus such as Udar (Josh), Bala, Brijesh, Rajan, Jana, and others - also Sudeepji from administrative side.  Venkat said he would also like to come for the dry run.

    Namah Shivaya,
    
    Hard disk failures in mobile vibration prone environments is a matter of concern for us esp. for G-VIA.Some options to be tried after PRMC meeting.
    
    We have a few options:-
    
    1)Using IDE Flash Disk which is a solid state device. We have a couple of 1 GB IDE 2.5" Flash disks. Linux OS will need to be pruned to fit in to the flash disk. Cost is a little too high for flash disks.
    Check this link :http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/
    
    2)Another option is to make or procure a vibration resistant case for HDD. There are a few people who are experimenting on this esp. with fluids.
    
    3)Another option is using a high memory.
    
    Some interesting links: http://www.wayfarer.co.uk/solutions/gps/gpssurveying.htm

    <h1>Email from Mukti Trivedi (Recvd: Nov 2, 1:37pm) - Asking detailed documentation from our side</h1>
    
    <i>TIFAC is asking for detailed reports - my feeling is they may want to get these details before they eventually release 60 lakhs.  This is contrary to what was discussed during PRMC where they said they'll release 60 lakhs without need for any further documentation from our side. Email from Mukti follows. --jayaraj</i>
    
    Dear Mr. Jayaraj,
     
    How are you? Wish for  your good health.
     
    I tried to reach you on phone but couldn't .
    Can you please send me the report which Mr. Sajid was preparing during the meeting and also the presentation which you made before PRMC.
     
    Also kindly send me the document which clarifies the couple of things mentioned below: ( same was discussed during the meeting also)
    
    1. Clarification about the budget : why you want to keep the same budget mentioned in the agreement which is contradictory to what you have proposed in the workpackages submitted to TIFAC.
     
    2.  Which vehicles( KSRTC/ Amrita VV) will be used for the demonstration and how many numbers if on both vehicles it will be demonstrated. Which route will be followed. ( Also kindly choose the demonstrating vehicles which will be available for the demonstration before PRMC, mostly the timings of KSRTC vehicles)
     
    3. Kindly submit a detailed progress report which gives the details about which standard will  you be following, reason for choosing the same and any other relevant details if required.
     
    4. What is the strategy followed for the development of the prototype( like inhouse simulator and software development, inhouse design and fabrication), reason behind following that particular strategy and its benifits.
     
    5. Detailed description of the technology which will include:
    
    * Method used for locating/ tracking the device/ Vehicle .
    * Strategy followed for increasing the strength of the signal.
    * Features of the ITEWS  prototype. and strategy of incorporating them in the the project.
    * Any other relevant details. Strategy which will be followed for the improvement of ( Issues like ruggedness,  robustness, Increase signal strength ) of the  prototype.
    * Future plan towards the completion of the prototype development.
    
    I might missed some of the topics which needs to be incorporated in the report. So please incoporate other relevant information also which will aim to provide the complete information on the project status and its strategy for the development.
     
    You can contact to me on my pone/mobile if you want to clarify some of the above mentioned points.
     
    Best regards,

      How do we add the following features into our backup system:
      
      # Backup onto tape/DVD - what type of schedule should we follow for this.  Some manual intervention is required for this.  Mostly we can use DVD.  Tape can be used to backup large data chunks - for instance - GVIA harddisk image data (once it's finalized).
      # Sending the tape/DVD to offsite location for safekeeping.  Data need to be encrypted - can use gpg.
      # Daily offsite backup to some internet site - again data need to be encrypted - can use gpg.  This can be scripted and automated.

      Namah Shivaya
      
      BAckup discussion notes from today along with Jayaraj ji :-
      
      1.Need to purchase a 200 GB hard disk for sarveshwari daily disk backup. The present backup disk has very little space left.
      Also will need to buy a 80 GB or 200 GB hard disk for Durga.
      
      2.Need to try using the tape backup from a linux machine.We need to make the tape backup as painless as possible. If it works out to be easy,we can possibly take a weekly tape backup, encrypt using GPG and send one tape to AIMS every month. This tape can be rotated in successive turns.If the tape backup turns out to have more manual intervention, we can resort to bi-weekly or monthly backup.
      
      3.Cron job on Nandi to be modified to take care of file deletion for more than 3 days.
      
      4.Need to check up with JK in USA or Ettimadai to get server space so that we can encrypt our SVN data using GPG and upload it on a daily basis to have an offsite backup of our source codes.

    Namah Sivayah,
    
    Shall we meet tomorrow at 11:00am to form a clear plan of what we can accomplish  to demo the system to AMMA when She returns from the tour.
    
    Amit, Sriram, and myself briefly calculated the cost of GPS-based IVTU - it comes to around Rs. 12,000 - which may be far too expensive for mass deployment.  Our current IVTU costs less than Rs. 5000  - and may be the viable option for us from a product-perspective.  
    
    If we need to bring the cost down for GPS-based IVTU, we'd need to design using GPS and GSM chipsets - which will take around 6 months to get a stable version.
    
    We did a rough cost estimate as follows:
    
    Our TGATE cost (including access point) is around Rs. 20,000.  IVTU cost is around Rs. 5000.  For obtain arrival/departure time for 75 buses in Tvm-Cochin route at 10 stations the cost would be Rs. 20,000 x 10 + Rs. 5000 * 75 = 5.75 lakhs, in addition we'd  need 10 active SIM cards.
    
    If we use GPS-based system, the cost would be: Rs. 12,000 x 75 = 9 lakhs, in addition we'd need 75 active SIM cards.
    
    
    Agenda: 
    
    # Cost reduction for IVTU/TGATE
    # Test-bed facility at our lab/campus
    # Permanent GVIA/TCM installation at our bus
    # New IVTU board with proper casing
    # Simulator/Emulator 
    # TGATE board with proper casing
    # TID with proper casing
    # Set up a proper 24x7 TDCS/TIDS server machine
    # Getting started on brochure content/website
    
    We'll get Amma's guidance whether to continue with KSRTC trial deployment or to stick to our facilities for trial deployment.

      Few advantages of our existing IVTU are :
      1) It allows voice communication to the control station with no cost added.
      2) The version 4.0 of IVTU can be of significant value, if we can make the following changes:
         a) remove rabbit and go for ARM (major cost reducing factor $50 atleast)
         b) go for chipset for WiFi (this is can significantly reduce the cost $30 atleast). There are couple of issues with the chipset for WiFi. We need to signup with a company for chipset and development period.
      
      There is one issue with our WiFi technology. Since it is 802.11b based design, the specification can go outdated soon. Meaning taken over by 802.11g. The WiFi overall can get overtaken by WiMax solution. This is where GPS will be solid. There is no change to the technology.
      
      Do we need to add profit margins + research cost + custom duties incurred to the final pricing.

      To get a proper market survey done as to the current needs of the transport corporations/goods transport companies, could we get the help of Amrita Business School or Amrita TV in doing so?
      A batch of business school students could possibly do a summer project in this area.
      
      It will be worthwhile to get a report on current demands in the telematics market in India, so that the application we develop largely caters to these needs.
      
      There are survey reports from agencies like Frost & Sullivan on India telematics market.They are available at a price. We can buy them too.
      An outside-in approach for our product and market strategy would be of great utility, I believe.

      Namah Shivaya
      
      Few things which came to my mind and which I discussed with Sriram :-
      
      1)Since we have done so much work in bringing up this WiFi system, would it not be better to get this in to a product stage in the next couple of months? We were anyway scheduled to complete this by December end under ITEWS project.Once we get the latest boards ready, we can then install them in our own institution buses and sites, and get it working and study the performance.Continuing with KSRTC can also be considered, provided Amma gives her consent.A MoU with KSRTC for test installations would be desirable.
      
      2)We have already bought lot of WiFi compact flash cards, Access Points etc..which can really only be used for a telematics WiFi based system.If we switch to some other system now, maybe all this investment in equipments and components would go waste.
      
      3)Once we have a field-ready-version of the WiFi based system, we can then start develpoment on the GPS based system. As the development on this progresses, the WiFi based system would be maturing in robustness, stability, performance and accuracy.
      
      4)We have already some setup running at Kayankulam and Kollam bus stations. If we abandon this project straightway, there might be a backlash from these people and Amrita might get a bad name.If the fate of the ITEWS project is to close down, then TIFAC might give a negative picture of the whole thing to K.P Somarajan.One way it is also important to keep him in good humour.
      
      5)Probably six months down the line, by Amma's grace we could have two systems ready ,one based on Wifi and another based on GPS.WiFi based systems can be targetted for long distance inter-district transportation, and GPS based system can be targetted for Metro cities like Chennai, Mumbai etc.
      
      6)As mentioned in my previous posting, a market survey on the current demands of public/privatedtransporters would be a useful guide for our project development.
      
      7)A discussion with Sudhakar ji and Raghu ji with permission from Amma might help us in strategising the path forward.

      To summarize some of the points raised in previous comments and to add a few:
      
      # We do a trial deployment at Amrita or KSRTC using our current technology (IVTU v3, TGATE, TID, and TDCS/TIDS).  
      # KSRTC installation may be better - but we'll get Amma's permission for that - and also an MoU needs to be signed.
      # The trial deployment should come out as a system that end-user can use and having well packaged deployment components with clear installation manuals etc.
      # While the trial deployment is in progress we can work on next generation IVTU/TGATE etc having following features:
      ## A hybrid system supporting both wifi-based tracking and GPS/GSM-based tracking
      ## We develop one board based on ARM using serial wifi module, gps module, gsm module that can be used for TGATE and IVTU - the board can have provision for populating all the three if required.  
      ## The TGATE will have wifi and gsm modules populated and can be packaged in one single casted casing requiring only external DC power (may be 24v dc input so that we can use relatively long cables).
      ## Depending on the requirement of the transport agency we can install wifi-based IVTUs in some buses and gps-based IVTUs in others.
      ## We can also have a dual mode IVTU having wifi/gsm/gps modules that can optimize the use of SMS traffic such as:
      ### use wifi tracking within a certain region and outside the region will use gps tracking.  
      ### use sms only when the vehicle is stuck in traffic between two stations.
      # Parallelly we can also try to establish industry links and obtain chipsets to reduce overall cost as we go forward (this reduction in cost may simply result in more margins for us or we may opt to pass it on to the customer - whichever makes more business sense)

      Namah Shivaya,
      
      GVIA notes:-
      
      Private/public bus operators with television facilities in their buses would be generally playing movies through a DVD player. (Video cassette player hopefully is not used anymore).
      
      If GVIA is used primarily to play location aware advertisements during the course of screening of the movie, then we would need to have some kind of arrangement to switch from the DVD player to the PC to play the ads and then to switch back to the DVD mode to screen the rest of the movie.
      
      I am not sure how this can be done. I will also be checking with Srinivas ji on this.

      On the web, it says that Media link controller can be used to switch between PC and other devices like DVD player. Will need to find out if it can be programmatically done so.

    We need to have two views
    # Station view
    <BR> This shows 2 things
    ## Recent arrival and Departure times of vehicles at a particular station
    ## Recent(within last few hours) Arrival and departure times of vehicles at plus-minus one stations. This applies only to those vehicles which are scheduled to pass via the current station in near future
    
    # Vehicle view
    <BR> This shows most recent arrival and departure time at a station. If the vehicle has only arrived, then the vehicle is visually shown in the station otherwise if the vehicle has departed, then it is shown as midway between the source and destination station
    
    h2. TDCS
    
    Following modules may need to be developed, for us to be able to create a successful service based product (idea is to make something similar to projectpath itself)
    
    # Account Management
    <BR>This includes
    ## Access Control (Role-privilege based)
    ## User Add/Modify/Delete (Basic package can allow max 5 additional users. Anthing more than that will require additional money from customer
    
    # Bus schedule Management
    <BR>This includes
    ## Add/Modify/Delete Bus schedules
    
    # Network Management
    <BR>This includes
    ## Add/Modify/Delete buses

    <BR>This includes all the active stations/buses/alerts and also the mangement of the public information e.g. what pages can be viewed,  in web based vehicle view, what vehicles are to be shown etc. (the basic package can have 5 vehicles max and if the customer requires more, they will have to pay for it)
    
    # Archived Info + Statistics + Analaysis 
     This includes Archival of the data. The basic package can have archival for lets say 5 vechicles and upto max. of 1 GB space. Business model can be designed so that any further additions to this will require additional payments.
    
    # Server administration
    <BR>This is for us to administer the overall server (Account creation, usage)
    
    We can design our system in such a way that each customer will have a seperate database. Also later we can allow the customers to have their organization name as part of the url prefix e.g. sometransportagency.amritatelematics.com

    Namah Shivaya,
    
    Please find a document containing discussion notes on adhoc networks for your perusal.
    Entry and exit timings capture of vehicles at stations using adhoc wireless network could be our initial Phase of implementation.
    The next phase could possibly optimize use of GSM/GPS and exploit the capability of adhoc networking to keep costs down and to achieve fine grained location tracking of vehicles.
    
    NB: Please excuse me for the various loose ends in the document.

    Now it seems to me that to sell a GPS-based tracking system (either as
    product or service) availability of a proper backend GIS database is
    essential.
    
    The TGATE-based choke point monitoring system (so to speak) does not
    require this - so may be a better starting point for us.  Apart from
    arrival/departure time computation the system can also be used for
    security, goods-tracking etc.

    i agree with you JB.
    i guess we are more better off to start with TGATE-based implementation
    because
    - it is  novel idea, and can add more punch to marketing since we can
    proclaim it as somethign different from existing solutions
    - will be something new for indian market
    - can be made more economical to suit to indian market
    - we dont need exhaustive GIS base to start with
    
    Ofcourse our system may have limitations compared to continuous GPS based
    systems, but in certain industrial segements, this may be what a customer
    is looking for. One major challenge for us is to make it very cost
    effective and as much as possible, maintenance free. and obviously, our
    prenentation of the whole thing, including casing etc. of hardware
    components has to be great!
    
    Pls take a look at this - it talks about a vehicle tracking unit that GPS
    Integrated is using -
    http://chipsilicon.com/store/product_info.php?cPath=33&products_id=95
    I hope SB will get some good info from here (BTW, how is your motion SB? i
    guess you had some stomach problems!)
    
    We can also have things like Data Logger, as shown in "Using GPS
    Datalogger with Google Earth" -
    http://info.chipsilicon.com:8080/chipsilicon/products/gps-tracking/data_logger/datalogge-with-googleearth
    Ofcourse in our case we wont have continuous log, but for transport
    authorities e.g. we can assume the fixed routes and that information can
    be just fetched from some database that stores lat/long info for all
    routes.
    If you look at this link, please see towards the end if page - the last
    image looks good.

    I came across this THTTPD - supposedly lightweight fast web server: 
    
    http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/ .
    
    It's probably something we can try on GVIA/TCM to serve static content (images, video, audio) to the browser - we can test and see if the performance improves.  Of course, we will still use Apache-PHP for dynamic content.

      * To help local businessman develop multimedia ads, may be TCM can also provide some kind of 'ad wizard' which allows easy creation of multimedia ads in a standard format.
      
      * Should the ads be delivered as streaming media (using RTP) or be downloaded (using FTP/SFTP) and then played.  We've started an initial study of RTP (Aravind).  Development has not started on this.
      
      * On multimedia side: IVTU will have an MP3 hardware codec.  However, for video delivery I was wondering whether we should use MPEG (which has licencing issues) or open codecs such as Vorbis/Theora (http://www.xiph.org/).  I've mentioned to Silpa that her first module may be on vorbis - no work has been done on this so far since she's in Linux/C training phase.
      
      * IVTU transmitting its capabilities to TCM via protocol headers sounds good.
      
      * Right now, IVTU-TGATE communication is over UDP.  With X-VIA-TCM it may make sense to have a persistent control channel over TCP to exchange control/status messages while vehicle is in the TCM's hotzone. A BEEP-based protocol (http://www.beepcore.org/) may be good for this purpose?

      * Regarding multimedia, we definitely want to stay with an open standard or at least use a codec with a favorably worded license.
      
      * I agree that an 'ad wizard' is a very good idea.  All text, audio and video should be produced this way in order to insure uniformity and compatibility.
      
      * Streaming ads may work, but downloading may be more robust and fool-proof.

      Based on our discussions so far:
      
      (1) We'll go for file downloads (using ftp/sftp) for ad/multimedia delivery to G-VIA instead of streaming.  This enables better quality viewing and disconnected playbacks.
      
      (2) No 'ad wizard' - since it involves too much of work for a peripheral functionality.  The transportation agency can have a 'ad development' partner to whom local business people can go (probably at an adequately cheap rate).
      
      (3) We may have a browser-based application at G-VIA.

      I contacted the MP3 Device Support Engineer. This is reponse I received from them.
      
      "The MP3 license fee is included in the price of the device. So you do not have to pay any additional licenses.
      
      However there has been some confusion about this. We pay the license fee to Thomsom which is the patent holder for the MP3 format. Also there is an Italian company called Sisvel who claim that they too have the right to collect licence fees from manufacturers using MP3.
      
      Sisvel has patents to MP1 and MP2 (layer I and II) but we have not found anything in our layer III decoder that would violate Sisvel patents. If you use VS1011E or VS1033C and enable the layer I and II decoding then you are liable for the patent issues that may arise. But the MP3 license in included in the VS1002 price.
      
      If you decide to upgrade to VS1033C and use WMA you must sign a form that states that you are aware that you must take care of the licensing Microsoft if you use WMA in your product and send it to use before we can send you the devices."

      h1. TCM, G-VIA for AMMA's demo (Sep 24 meeting with Amit)
      
      TCM - Browser (Firefox) - PHP(with Smarty) - Mule - MySQL
      G-VIA - Browser (Firefox) - PHP(with Smarty) - Mule - MySQL
      
      TCM screens:
      
      # Business ad mgmt - add/edit/delete businesses and their ad entries.  
      ** [optional] Ad entry screen can have options for targeting the ad to vehicles based vehicle type (such as a/c, volvo, long-distance).  
      ** Ad types:
      *** Text-only - to be shown in T-VIA and G-VIA
      *** Text with audio (mp3)- to be shown in G-VIA and T-VIA (without audio)
      *** Image (jpeg) with audio (mp3) - to be shown in G-VIA (image is shown while audio is played)
      *** Video (mpeg) - G-VIA
      
      # Graphical view of vehicles present in hotzone with vehicle details.
      
      
      AD Delivery
      
      # Vehicle type is provided to TCM by the G-VIA
      # If TCM is present it will also act as TGATE
      # TCM also tells the G-VIA when to play the ad (i.e. at which TGATE).  
      # G-VIA acts as an IVTU and sends LUP and gets LAK to/from TGATE 
      # If hotzone has TCM instead of a regular TGATE, TCM will add a field in the LAK message indicating its presence - so that G-VIA can establish advertisement download channels.
      # G-VIA should have a cache of ads indexed by originating TCM and ad-signature.
      # TCM will first send ad signatures, then G-VIA will request for download of ads not currently in its cache or which have been modified. Will also remove ad no longer required.
      # When G-VIA sees a TGATE, it will trigger the ads stored in the cache which have to be played at that location. 
      
      News
      
      # TGATE can push news feeds to G-VIA/T-VIA - which can appear as scrolling ticker
      # TGATE gets news updates from TDCS, which in turn gets it from RSS feeds of one or more selected news sites.
      
      General demo guidelines
      
      # Take video of following scenarios
      ** Business person coming to TCM operator and placing an ad.
      ** Bus entering a hotzone and ad being played on G-VIA
      ** TDCS web access - for general public over Internet, transport officials
      ** Simulate a TID using monitor - public looking at the info
      ** TCM display of vehicles in the hotzone
      ** News feeds to G-VIA from TGATE

      -- Come out with a to-do list for movement to the engineering block
      
      
      TCM functionalities
      ___________________
      
      1. Allow shop owners to bring in text for advertising and the operator at the bus station managing the TCM can upload them
      2. The idea of allowing video for advertisement was thought over. For initial deployment we can get some good videos done by our multimedia dept. and get it displayed on the G-VIA
      3.Photos of shops etc. in digital format can be accepted by the operator to load in to the TCM
      4. In addition to advertisements, localities in and around the bus station can be shown on google maps and this can be shown on the G-VIA

    Shall we have a TGATE/TID/TCM test-bed at our campus here?
    
    To begin with:
    
    # Have two TGATEs installed at two points at our campus (maybe at biotech and engg blocks).  The installation should mirror as closely as possible a real bus station installation.
    
    # We can fit IVTU (and later T-VIA, G-VIA) into one of our buses.
    
    # We can also think about the idea of 'T-Bike' that is IVTU fitted onto a bicycle for testing
    
    # Later, we can put one TGATE at each of our campuses I think.

      Will this tgate be the final one, which case we can get a case built for it using aluminium or plastic?
      
      Also will this tgate support SMS for backup?

    # General Protocol Notes:
    
    ** Each message is delimited by a single newline character (\n).
    ** Each message begins with a three-char message-type followed by msg payload.
    
    # Security Notes:
    
    ** IVTU-TGATE communication: The Access Point has MAC-ID filtering enabled.  WEP/WPA is not enabled (reason: it slows the association time).  The SSID is kept secret and SSID broadcast is disabled.
    ** TGATE->TDCS communication: TDCS accepts data from TGATE only after it sends a registration message with valid TGATE-ID and password
    
    
    # IVTU->TGATE messages
    
    ** Location Update
    
    *** Purpose: To tell TGATE that IVTU is active in its hotzone.
    
    *** Format:
    <code>
    LUP <IVTU-ID> <LOCATION-NAME-RECVD-FLAG> <SEQ-NUM> <RSSI> <NOISE> <SIGNAL QUALITY>\n
    
    
    <IVTU-ID> is of the form Vnnn (such as V001)
    
    <LOCATION-NAME-RECVD-FLAG> is either 'U' or 'L' indicating whether IVTU has received current location name from TGATE.  'U' indicates current location name is unknown, 'L'  indicates that IVTU has received the location name from TGATE.  TGATE sends a Location Acknowledge message when it receives a LUP from IVTU with this flag set to 'U'.
    
    <SEQ-NUM> is a monotically increasing integer indicating seq number of the LUP message (starts from 0 on entry to a new hotzone)
    
    <RSSI>, <NOISE>, and <SIGNAL QUALITY> are figures indicate of received signal strength, noise, and signal quality of received signal - can be used for diagnostic purposes.
    </code>
    
    # TGATE->IVTU messages
    
    ** Location Acknowledge
    *** Purpose: To provide current location name to IVTU
    *** Format:
    <code>
    LAK <TGATE-ID> <location name>
    <location name> has max 16 chars to fit one line of 16x2 display of IVTU.  <location name> is what TGATE receives from TDCS through <LNM> message.  In case TGATE has not received <LNM> message from TDCS it sends its TGATE-ID as <location-name>.
    </code>
    
    # TGATE->TDCS Messages
    
    ** Registration
    *** Purpose: Provide TGATE ID and authentication password to TDCS after a TCP connect.
    *** Format:
    <code>
    REG <TGATE-ID> <PASSWORD>\n
    
    <TGATE-ID> is of the form Tnnn (such as T001)
    
    Example:
    REG T001 abcd\n</code>
    ** Location Update
    *** Purpose: Send list of vehicles recently seen by TGATE along with timestamps.
    *** Format:
    <code>
    LUP <TGATE-ID> <IVTU-ID> <TIMESTAMP>, <IVTU-ID> <TIMESTAMP>, ...\n
    
    <TIMESTAMP> uses 1980 epoch (no of seconds since Jan 1 1980)
    
    Example:
    LUP T001 V001 1234567, V002 1234567
    </code>
    
    ** Events
    *** Purpose: To send diagnostic events. These events are also send to Port '9091' of IP '10.1.254.253' in local network for local-area diagnostics.
    *** Format:
    <code>
    EVT <TGATE-ID> <EVENT-ID> <TIMESTAMP> <OPTIONAL EVENT PARAMS>\n
    </code>
    Valid Event IDs and params:
    *** IFCST: Interface Status.
    Param: UP, DOWN
    *** LINK: Eth link status
    Param: UP, DOWN
    *** GPINIT: GPRS modem init
    *** GPBOOT: GPRS modem booting up
    Param: <Boot State>
    *** GPATT: GPRS modem attached to network
    *** GPREG: GPRS modem registered onto GPRS.
    Param: <GPRS IP>
    *** GPCONN: GPRS modem connected to TDCS
    
    
    # TDCS->TGATE messages
    
    ** Time Update
    *** Purpose: To sync TGATE time with central TDCS time. Usually send once immediately after getting REG msg from TGATE.
    *** Format:
    <code>
    TUP <TIMESTAMP IN 1980 EPOCH>\n
    </code>
    
    ** Location Name
    *** Purpose: To provide human-friendly name of the TGATE location.  This will be display at TGATE display and also send to IVTUs.
    *** Format:
    <code>
    LNM <LOCATION-NAME>\n
    
    <LOCATION-NAME> must have max 16 chars to allow display in one line of 16x2 TGATE and IVTU display
    </code>
    
    # TID->TDCS Messages
    
    ** Registration - same format as TGATE->TDCS registration msg
    
    
    # TDCS->TID Messages
    
    ** Time Update
    Same format at TDCS->TGATE timeupdate msg
    
    ** Location Display
    *** Purpose: Send vehicle information messages to be displayed at TID.
    *** Format:
    <code>
    LDP <TID-ID> <IVTU-ID> <TIMESTAMP> <MESSAGE>, <IVTU-ID> <TIMESTAMP> <MESSAGE>, ...\n
    
    <MESSAGE> is ascii text message for vehicle identified by the corresponding IVTU ID, to be displayed at the TID.
    
    <TIMESTAMP> uses 1980 epoch.
    <TIMESTAMP> allows newer messages to get priority in display (and in storage - when it gets full)
    
    <IVTU-ID> allows TID to store one message per IVTU

      We had had a look at some xml based standards quite some time back. It may be a good idea to take a look at some of those or atleast to be aware of these.
      
      |*Standard Name*|*Short Description*|*Referrer URL*|
      |GML|Geography Markup Language (GML) is the XML grammar defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to express geographical features|"GWML":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language|
      |RWML|Road Web Markup Language (RWML) consists of the following four parts, 1) Road Information 2) Weather Information 3) Disaster Information 4) Regional Information|"RWML":http://rwml.its-win.gr.jp/eng/|
      |NVML|NaVigation Markup Language (NVML) has the capability to describe several types of navigation information such as a route from the current point to a destination point, a way to a shop from the nearest station, transportation courses, sightseeing courses, and tour schedules. This language is able to describe location informaton as latitude, longitude, address and various additional items|"NVML":http://xml.coverpages.org/nvml.html|
      |SyncML|Synchronization Markup Language (SyncML) is most commonly thought of as a method to synchronize contact and calendar information between some type of handheld device and a computer (personal, or network-based service), such as between a mobile phone and a personal computer.Existing synchronization solutions have mostly been somewhat vendor-, application- or operating system specific. The purpose of SyncML is to change this by offering an open standard as a replacement|"SyncML":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncML|

      h1. Using ASN.1 notation
      
      
      It may be a good idea to represent protocol message structures using ASN.1 notation in our standards document - independent of any particular representation syntax (such as XML).  Then provide an XML realization of the messages by defining DTD or XML schema.

      After discussion with Jayarajji, the following points were clarified.
      
      1. LNM and TUP are sent in response to REG.
      2. Empty LAK is sent in response to LUP.
      3. Currently, LDP was being sent in response to LUP. The corresponding code segment will be commented out.
      4. LAK will be an empty message object. Later on we can probably have a seq number for each LUP and LAK can ack the seq number.

      When handling LUP msgs, an array of LDP msgs were returned based on database query. But now with LAK, we don't have any database query. So, we need to return only one LAK msg whether it is an array of LUPs or a single LUP.
      
      We've separate display from TGATE (display will be in TID).
      When we start developing TID, we'll use the LDP messages.

      h1. GVIA, TGATE, and TCM
      
      # When GVIA comes into a hotzone with TGATE a regular LUP-LAK exchange occurs between GVIA and TGATE.
      
      # When GVIA comes into a hotzone with TCM first a LUP-LAK exchange occurs as follows:
      ** <code> GVIA [sends] LUP <params> [to] TCM </code>
      ** <code> GVIA [receives] LAK <TCM-ID> <LOC-NAME> CAP=TCM  [from] TCM </code>
      ** <code>THE CAP=TCM optional parameter tells GVIA that the other end has TCM capability.</code>
      
      # Then GVIA can first download an XML file describing the adverts available at TCM intended for this GVIA. This can be done via an HTTP GET one a URL such as <code>http: //10.1.254.254/adinfo.php?gvia=<GVIA-ID>.</code>
      
      #  Then GVIA checks its local cache (may be a database) to see which ads it already has, which are new, updated etc.  Then it downloads the new and updated ads from the TCM and deletes the unwanted ads from its cache.  This download can also happen via HTTP GET/POST mechanism via a URL such as <code>http: //10.1.254.254/addownload.php?gvia=<GVIA-ID>&ad-id=<AD-ID>...etc</code>

    Last week I had spoken to Sajid Mubashir - Director, Core Group on Automotive Research, Technology Information Forecasting & Assessment Council (TIFAC).  He was asking when should the next PRMC meeting happen - I suggested first week of October. According to the original schedule it was supposed to happen in August, so we cannot delay it further.
    
    Shall we meet to discuss on this.  What should be the agenda items?
    
    Should we target a demo during the PRMC?  It would be good to show the demo - otherwise we'll have to answer too many questions from their side.  However unless it is a really impressive one with good visual as well as actual technology behind it, they may not care much about it either.

      Some of the ideas discussed during meeting on 20th Sep, to make the Demo as attractive as possible are:
      
      # Google Map Integration on TDCS
      # Local Maps (Google version) with overlayed images of businesses to be displayed on G-VIA
      # Webcam capture of Railway Schedules
      # Show that we have followed some open standards (preferable some document also)
      # Show that we have scientifically made observations - some graphs etc. [see "IVTU/TGATE Simulator Ideas" message thread for details]

    Initial ideas for demo script that came up in Sep 19/20 meetings on Oct PRMC are:
    
    [Note: After getting initial comments we can probably move this to a write-board]
    
    # Presenter: Welcome note
    # Presenter: Agenda (2-3 lines)
    # System: A notification sound on some ITEWS event
    # System: Protocol simulator/visualizer appears to give them a feel how real thing is going to be. 
    # Presenter: Walks through different scenarios, such as if you are station master what would you see etc.
    # Simulator-generated graphs of various factors like round-trip-time, latency, signal strength etc is shown.
    # Then we overwhelm them by zooming out and showing the
    amount of activity going on Then again zoom in and show what is happening at the TGATEs
    # And then we show the TDCS
    # Early view of TCM Apps
    # Site survey data is shown
    # Talk - key phrases/lines:
    ** "It would be cost prohibitive to show 10 or 50 buses, so thats
    why we have developed simulators to thoroughly test the system. Purpose of simulators is to show the Integrity of the system."
    ** We talk about the slip of goals and how we have been
    able to make up for it(we start up with this so that they
    dont keep itching to ask the question)
    ** Why we screwed up and now what we can do to overcome it
    ** We are not here to show you smoke'n'mirrors but the real stuff
    i.e. what we have right now. We are quite anxious to show you...
    ** Every time a lemon comes, mix sugar and push it back
    dont discuss about lemons - only talk about lemonade
    ** New Project Management system  - If someone asks
    too much about August slippage

    IVTU/TGATE simulator ideas discussed in Sep 19/20 meetings for Oct PRMC:
    
    # Simulator must have a simulator engine and a visualizer (could be web-based).
    # Simulator engine and the visualizer is best written in a scripting language such as ruby
    # The configuration, input data set for the simulator can be provided in YAML format.
    # Visualizations:
    ** Protocol visualization - graphical representation of the message sequence etc
    ** Graphs/Plots of various data captured from simulator runs such as:
    *** LUP-to-LAK delay vs No. of IVTUs - How number of IVTUs in a hotzone affect delay between LUP transmit and LAK receipt by IVTU.
    *** LUP-to-LUP delay vs No. of IVTUs - How number of IVTUs in a hotzone affect delay between LUP transmit by IVTU and corresponding LUP receipt by TDCS.  This will also give us the GPRS latency.
    *** LUP losses vs No. of IVTUs: No of LUP messages lost vs No. of IVTUs in a hotzone.
    *** Mean, median, mode values can be plotted.
    *** TODO - Other similar plots such as signal strength plot.
    ** May be look for pre-built graph/plot library in ruby. Found one: http://nubyonrails.com/pages/gruff
    
    # Simulator Engine
    ** Two different simulators - IVTU simulator that simulates multiple IVTUs and TGATE simulator that simulates multiple TGATEs
    ** Both can take some basic vehicle schedule information from a shared database - put some percentage of randomization - to generate vehicle arrival/departure times at different stations.
    
    # IVTU simulator
    ** One instance of IVTU simulator can simulate IVTUs arriving and departing at one station.  On the event of a vehicle arrival at a station the simulator starts generating appropriate IVTU messages, and on the event of the vehicle departure it stops generating LUP messages.
    ** IVTU simulator generates actual IVTU messages which can be taken and processed by an actual TGATE.
    
    # TGATE simulator
    ** One instance of TGATE simulator can simulate multiple TGATEs to a set of actual IVTUs kept statically at the TGATE simulator's hotzone.
    ** Entering and leaving of hotzone by the IVTU can be simulated by programmatically adding/removing the IVTU's MAC address from the MAC address filter list of the Access Point connected to the TGATE simulator.  
    ** When an IVTU's mac id is not in the MAC id filter list of AP, the IVTU will keep looking for hotzone, and when the mac id is added to the list, IVTU will find and attach to the hotzone.
    ** The same instance of the TGATE simulator can give different TGATE ID's to different IVTU based on the IVTU's IP address/IVTU id and based on which station IVTU is supposed to be at that point in time.

    h1. Sajid Mubashir's email (Recvd: Sep 21 2006 11:40am)
    
    It is better to plan for a good demo of critical mass/ size before the PRMC.  So I am marking copy of this mail to Prof. Jamadagni, Chairman, PRMC.  We will have to find a date suitable to both the Chairman, PRMC and Dr. Venkat Rangan right-away, and then work towards this stiff target.
    
    Yesterday, two officials of the Kerala State S&T Council visited us.  We discussed with them the possibility of an enlarged consortium targetting specific usable pilot technology demonstrator for enhancing the public transportation network in Kerala.  It appears that the best application is to build something that will facilitate tourism.   They are confident of bringing in the Kerala State Tourism Development agency, the NATPAC (the transport planning agency) and KSRTC in a big way.  However I still want significant private company participation.
    
    While the pilot application should be of immediate relevance to the local commuters, we could also aim higher by assuming sophisticated European travellers also as a "type user".  With this in view we could plan a road-triangle comprising Kovalam --> Iddukki --> Kochi.  This is somewhat parallel to your existing plan of Kollam --> Kochi.
    
    The application could enable a variety of facilities for advance planning of travel, accessible over web and mobile devices (perhaps).  And remember the exciting point made by Dr. Venkat Rangan at CAR-PAC that caught everyone's attention - one of enabling revenue streams that are outside of the road user/ commuter.  If we target tourism as one of the applications, then it can couple also with a GIS facility that gives information on hotel locations (& even booking), restaurants, places to visit (later expandable to write ups/ photos etc.).
    
    So, we will need a consortium member who is good at GIS.  The S&T Council officials said that the Kerala State Remote Sensing Agency can be a help in this.  In any case, the DST had got developed an Indian GIS known as 'GRAM" at IIT Bombay.  For more information on this, please contact Prof. Krithi Ramamritham, Dean R&D, IIT Bombay < krithi@iitb.ac.in>.
    
    The idea would be to improve trip-information/ ticket-reservation for long distance bus service in Kerala, and while doing so, to pitch it as a facility that will provide a great (low cost) travel experience for tourists also!
    
    Can you comment on this topic?
    
    This mail is copied to Dr. V. Ajit Prabhu, Principal Scientific Officer, KSCSTE, Barthra Bhavan, Pattam, Thiruvanthapuram-14.  He had visited us yesterday alongwith Mr. K.U. Unnithan, Member-Secretary, KSCSTE.
    
    Obviously, this email is only a consultation process.  You will have to decide the further course of the project.  I am personally keen to explore the possibility of setting up a good size consortium for this Intelligent Transportation System effort.
    
    best regards,
    Sajid Mubashir.

With this in view we could plan a road-triangle comprising Kovalam&#8212;> Iddukki&#8212;> Kochi.  This is somewhat parallel to your existing plan of Kollam&#8212;> Kochi.</p>
    
    	<p>The application could enable a variety of facilities for advance planning of travel, accessible over web and mobile devices (perhaps).  And remember the exciting point made by Dr. Venkat Rangan at <span class="caps">CAR</span>-PAC that caught everyone&#8217;s attention &#8211; one of enabling revenue streams that are outside of the road user/ commuter.  If we target tourism as one of the applications, then it can couple also with a <span class="caps">GIS</span> facility that gives information on hotel locations (&#38; even booking), restaurants, places to visit (later expandable to write ups/ photos etc.).</p>
    
    	<p>So, we will need a consortium member who is good at <span class="caps">GIS</span>.  The S&#38;T Council officials said that the Kerala State Remote Sensing Agency can be a help in this.  In any case, the <span class="caps">DST</span> had got developed an Indian <span class="caps">GIS</span> known as &#8216;GRAM&#8221; at <span class="caps">IIT </span>Bombay.  For more information on this, please contact Prof. Krithi Ramamritham, Dean R&#38;D, <span class="caps">IIT </span>Bombay < <a href="mailto:krithi@iitb.ac.in">krithi@iitb.ac.in</a>>.</p>
    
    	<p>The idea would be to improve trip-information/ ticket-reservation for long distance bus service in Kerala, and while doing so, to pitch it as a facility that will provide a great (low cost) travel experience for tourists also!</p>
    
    	<p>Can you comment on this topic?</p>
    
    	<p>This mail is copied to Dr. V. Ajit Prabhu, Principal Scientific Officer, <span class="caps">KSCSTE</span>, Barthra Bhavan, Pattam, Thiruvanthapuram-14.  He had visited us yesterday alongwith Mr. K.U. Unnithan, Member-Secretary, <span class="caps">KSCSTE</span>.</p>
    
    	<p>Obviously, this email is only a consultation process.  You will have to decide the further course of the project.  I am personally keen to explore the possibility of setting up a good size consortium for this Intelligent Transportation System effort.</p>

      We can have the the PRMC meeting during the last week of Oct as desired by you. 
      AS mentioned in the workpackages sent by you to TIFAC we expect the demo of the following workpackages before the PRMC.
      
      # WP-1: IVTU  Location tacking and information interchage between vehicle and bus.
      # WP-2: PID - Interface with the In- Vehicle Telematics Unit and Traveler Information display.
      # WP-5 TGATE/TID: Capture vehicle information from vehicle coming into the bus station.
      # WP-6 TDCS: Aggregation, disseminationand analysis of data received from the vehicle with IVTU.
      # And some of the task of WP-7: Telematics control and monitoring and WP-8  as per the submitted schedule .

    body: "I think Mubhashir's words viz. \"It is better to plan for a good demo of critical mass/ size before the PRMC\" are quite critical.\n\n\
      Plus, he also talks about road-triangle comprising Kovalam\xE2\x80\x94> Iddukki\xE2\x80\x94> Kochi.\n\n\
      Related to tourism, he says _If we target tourism as one of the applications, then it can couple also with a GIS facility that gives information on hotel locations (& even booking), restaurants, places to visit (later expandable to write ups/ photos etc.)_\n\
      Does this mean that we need some sort of application on the similar lines for our PRMC or is it enough if we just talk about the potential and possibilities of having such kind of applicaitons\n\n\
      He has mentioned _Prof. Krithi Ramamritham, Dean R&D, IIT Bombay < krithi@iitb.ac.in>_. Do we need to contact him?"

      h1. Mubashir's email (Recvd: Sep 25 2006 11:22pm)
      
      Dear Jayaraj,
      My responses to your emails often introduce new topics!  This is because
      something is really bothering me; it is not about the project progress but
      about the sub-critical size of the effort itself.
      
      This project is conceived as something that the Amrita Labs alone will
      do (with
      KSRTC as a recepient), and such approach appears as an aberration in the
      CAR program of consortia research.  The discussion on IP creation and
      protection at Amrita has arisen in this context.  In a real consortium, we
      expect several or all members to be able to generate know-how and have
      ownership rights over the innovations that they bring in.   The entire
      consortia will benefit from the pooling of such know-how.
      
      In my last mail I outlined one way of taking up a large enough project that
      will make an impact - by bringing in some partners for undertaking a project
      targetting the tourism industry in Kerala.  There could be other such
      opportunities.
      # I understand from Prof. Mohan that the Bangalore authorities are keen to have a major ITS project.
      # There are people like Dr. Surinder Kapur who are keen to discuss (he is starting a car rental company - like Hertz).
      # There are NASSCOM companies like TCS, ...
      
      The options are many, if we want to generate a consortium.  I would
      certainly want a discussion on this to happen.
      So, I expect to learn of your views in the matter, and am willing to
      facilitate such consortium-development-meetings.  If there is difficulty,
      then of course I will turn to other such potential candidates to generate
      the requisite consortia, as envisaged under the CAR Technology Roadmap.
      best regards,

      h1. My comments to Balamuralidhar's questions regarding work package doc (Sent: Sep 28 7:00pm)
      
      Following are the clarifications to  Dr. Balamuralidharan's inputs on the ITEWS Workpackages document:
      
      (1)  The architecture that was presented during the 1st PRMC remains unchanged now as well.  The ITEWS system uses a heterogenous network consisting of WiFi for local communication and GPRS/Internet for backhaul.  We will be demonstrating applications that run on TCM and G-VIA that utilize the bandwidth of WiFi.
      
      (2)  The workpackages document outlines the work required only.    We will be presenting requirements specification document (based on requirements captured from KSRTC) and an architecture specification document which builds on the architecture overview document that we presented during the 1st PRMC.
      
      (3)  We will be demonstrating a simulator that we've built for testing the ITEWS system as well as data collected from simulator runs.
      
      Thank you,
      
      Regards,
      Jayaraj

      h1. My response to Mubashir's email on Sep 21 and Sep 25 (Sent: Sep 26)
      
      
      Dear Sajid,
      
      I think tourism as a key revenue-generating application of the ITEWS system is a great idea.  While the basic ITEWS network consisting of TGATE, TID, and IVTUs can provide travel information services to regular passengers, the TCM-GVIA can provide revenue-generating services such as Location-based multimedia ads and location-based tourist information.
      
      We're in the process of setting up a good-sized demo based on our work so far.  We hope that it would provide a good platform to generate discussion on potential applications and future directions, during the PRMC.
      I may be meeting Dr. Venkat in the next couple of days (he will be arriving today) and will discuss with him regarding tourism as a key application as well as regarding the development of a consortium.
      Thank you,
      
      Regards,
      Jayaraj

      h1. Mubashir's email on Oct 1 - pushing consortia - suggesting PRMC in Mid Oct
      
      Dear Jayaraj,
      
      We are glad that Dr. Venkat Rangan and you have said that the PRMC could meet immediately;  but we must give adequate notice, so middle October appears good to me. 
      
      TIFAC will expect good preparation for this important meeting through submission of reports/ email discussions. Else, if we start with a meeting directly, then it is possible that the discussions (including the additional information/ clarification that may be necessary) may continue by correspondence till we reach sufficient understanding /agreement.
      
      I will stress the need to move to a consortia mode.    In this context, personally I don't like the acronym PRMC  because of the stress on "monitoring";  rather I would have preferred to include "guidance" - and from that perspective, if these on-site discussions lead to some collaborative work with the reviewers, I will personally like to facilitate it.
      
      In short, we expect an "active review" and not a "hands-off" commenting.   And if the reviewers may like to guide through a demo, or take up some item where the team needs support, or guide them into a collaborative work with other agencies - these will only demonstrate that the TIFAC's review mechanism is effective.  In all this, Jayaraj, you may expect to hear true criticism - one with an intent to move the project towards excellence.
      
      So, whether you find partners within Kerala or outside, clearly for me a solo effort by some (brilliant) researchers sitting inside of the Amrita Labs is not enough.   The intent of C.A.R. is to mount critical size efforts and deliver technology to the transportation industry (includes both vehicle or road stakeholders); and of all the problems in the country, public transportation is an acute one that affects millions.
      
      ITS helps expand capacity/ throughput of the roads, and help the govt. postpone costly expansion of the road network.  So, this project is about resolving some aspect of "enhancing road-network through ITS", which you have called "ITEWS" .
      
      warm regards,
      Sajid Mubashir

      Dear Jayaraj,
      
      This is very good.  What does the photos on the right side indicate?
      
      I will request Mukti to keep you informed about the progress of the
      GSM-Telematics project at Koyembedu@Chennai; so that you can
      benchmark your work.

      h1. Our response to Sajid's email on TIDS
      Dear Sajid,
      
      Thank you for the encouragement.  Photos on the right side are just placeholders for additional information that we'll be putting into the TIDS system - for instance some local photos/maps/info (for the currently selected hotzone) of traveler/tourist interest can be shown there or advertisements of local businesses.  Later on, the TIDS can be enhanced to become national/regional transportation information portal.
      
      It'll be good for us to get information regarding Koyembedu project - it'll help us in benchmarking and improving upon our work.
      
      Regards,

      h1. Sajid's query on GIS/Google Earth
      
      Dear Jayaraj,
      
      While I understand GIS a little, I am not familiar with Google Earth Maps.  So can you please elaborate on your earlier statement that instead of "custom" GIS one could use Google Maps? 
      
      Are the Google Maps geo-coded?  Otherwise, can you consider superimposing actual maps (obtained from Survey of India) on top of the imagery?  I can easily link you to SoI.  And for your information, the Koyembedu Project is now led by Dr. Rajagopalan, who is the CEO of a Spatial Data Systems company.
      
      Please find attached a write on "directed basic research in automotive electronics".  I will like to know your and Dr. Venkat Rangan's comment on it, particularly the ITS section; please look out for the "road OS" reference, and tell me if this sounds ok.  I will be most grateful if you can spot the errors/ inconsistencies  in the write up, since we have to submit this to planning commission now.
      
      This mail is copied to Prof. Jamadagni also.  I will be grateful for his comments; though this is only a copy of an email.  I request indulgence in this regard.
      
      warm regards,
      Sajid.

      h1. Telephonic conversation with Mukti Trivedi
      
      She said there's a Program advisory committee (PAC) meeting on Nov 3 where they want to discuss the status of this project - so they wanted to have the meeting a bit earlier.  She suggested 26th, 27th.  I said we can't have it to too early since we won't get preparation time - but 28th, 29th, or 30th is ok with us.
      
      Some points Mukti Trivedi raised:
      
      # Have we extended the hotzone range? I replied we're using AP with longer range and also we can bridge multiple APs to extend range. We may need to setup one extended hotzone to demonstrate.
      
      # Have we used ad-hoc network as Jamadagni suggested?  I said Ad hoc is mostly useful when lot of vehicles are fitted with IVTU. 
      
      # Are we using 802.11g - weren't we using 802.11a?  I said we've never used 802.11a - we're using 802.11g access points, GVIA is using 802.11g card, but IVTU uses 802.11b card since data rate it requires is very less.  Some throughput measurements may be good to show.

    # we started showing the presentation to AMMA.  Showed the IVTU to AMMA.
    # AMMA asked which vehicle we've put the IVTU.   
    # we replied that we've put it in our car and college 407 bus.
    # AMMA asked whether it's permanent installation.
    # we replied that it's permanent installation in 407 bus.
    # we described the system to AMMA [like - each bus will have an IVTU, each bus station has a small computer to capture IVTU data which is sent to a central computer.  Some buses have bigger monitors and can show advertisements.)
    # AMMA said since most of the public transport buses were operated by government and private participation in this sector is less, the system would be useful for government only.
    # AMMA asked whether the presentation was using live data. 
    # we replied that it contained photographs - not live data.
    # AMMA made fun of us - saying we should have shown live data.
    # we mentioned to AMMA that TIFAC wants to bring in other organizations into the project and also that they haven't released money properly.
    # AMMA asked the details of money released by TIFAC, and said strongly that if others come in they may take away our IP - so we cannot let others come into the project.  We can even tell TIFAC that we are prepared to refund all their money back if they require, but still we cannot have other parties coming into the project.

    Site visit to Kayankulam
    Talked to officials there. Made arrangements with the Control Inspector so as to start work on installation at Kayankulan Bus station.
    
    Team visited :Jayaraj,Amit,Sriram,Ranjith
    
    June 2,2006
    
    Visit to Kayankulam Bus Station (KYM).
    
    Team visited: Ranjith,Amit,Sriram and Jayaraj
    
    Using laptops, PDA and Access Points we made a survey as to the likely places for installation of Access Points. Identified possible electrical outlets from where power could be drawn.
    
    Initially we had two laptops talk on an ad-hoc mode and did a few tests to find out the farthest distance from the Kym terrace we could have the communication up.
    Amit and Sriram walked all around the bus station carrying the laptop and checking for the signal strength, meanwhile myself and Jayaraj were on the top of the terrace.
    
    A number of curious auto rickshaw fellows were surrounding our brave two team members to find out what they were doing on the middle of the road! Amit in his characteristic non-Malayalam was seen answering their queries.
    
    Duration: Afternoon , 3 hours
    
    June 5,2006
    _____________
    
    Trip to KYM
    
    Team visited: Ranjith along with two electricians
    
    Electricians surveyed the place to take electrical connections to the point of the Access Point Installation.
    
    Access Point installed (Netgear AP) with the outdoor metallic cover.
    
    Electricians laid electrical PVC pipes and cabling for power.

      *Amrita Safelock - A Standalone Door Access Control* 
      
      	Amrita Safelock is an indigenously developed door access control device that can handle a maximum of n users. Being a standalone security lock, it doesn't need a dedicated back-end server for user authentication. However, one can optionally plug in a remote laptop or Pc for user configuration and for downloading the audit trails for subsequent viewing or printing. 
      
      *Features of Amrita Safelock*
      
      1. Round the clock door access control and security. 
      
      2. Dynamic user configuration using a remote computer. User configuration includes user addition, user deletion, modification 
      of user privileges etc. 
      
      3. If the user doesn't want to do any user configuration himself, he could opt out from the dynamic user configuration feature and get it preset by the supplier.
      
      4. Remote opening of door using active RFID tag or computer.
      
      5. Remote downloading of audit trails using a computer for subsequent viewing or printing.
      
      6. Built-in Buzzer support
      
      7. Stylish casing design - Gloss finished Plastic or Wooden casings for Card Reader Unit (CRU) and Door Control Unit(DCU).
      
      8. SMS messaging to the user's cell phone whenever any user other than himself opens the door.  
      
      9. External forced lock mode to prevent unauthorized opening through mail slot or window.
      
      10. Built-in Burglar Alarm during forced break-ins.
      
      11. Built-in Web camera Support.
      
      *Basic Components of Amrita Safelock*
      
      1. *Card Reader Unit (CRU)*
      	Placed outside the door.  CRU can be either Smartcard Reader Unit (SCRU) or Proximity-card Reader Unit (PCRU)
      
      2. *Passive RFID tags* for communicating with the CRU and provided within a smart card, a chain pendant or even attached to a watch strap.
      
      3. *Door Control Unit (DCU)*
      	Placed inside the door. CRU is connected to DCU via a RS232c serial cable.
      
      4. *Magnetic Lock Unit (MLU)*
      	Placed on the top of the door. MLU can be placed inside the door only if door opens outwards, otherwise MLU must be 
      placed outside the door. MLU is connected to DCU through a pair of copper cables.
      
      5. *Built-in-Buzzer*
      	Can be used by a person to alert the door user inside the room and thus get the door opened for him.
      
      6. *Power Supply*
      	Remotely located in a hidden place. Connected to Door Control Unit (DCU) using LAN ethernet.
      
      7. *UPS*
      	Optional. Remotely located along with the Power Supply.
      
      8. *PC/Serial printer*
      	Optional. Remotely located. Can be used for user configuration, for downloading audit trials for subsequent viewing and for remotely opening the door.
      
      9. *Web Camera*
      	Optional. For added security.
      
      *Potential Applications of Amrita Safelock*
      
      1. *Bank Manager's Room*
      	Using an access control device, a bank manager can restrict entry to his room, especially when he has to leave important papers unattended on his table during the peak working hours. But if he wants a few people to have free access to his room, they could easily be added to the lock configuraion. The  privileges of each user can also be configured independently. For example, some users can be limited entry to his room during the bank working hours, while others can have round-the-clock rights. When the manager is seated and someone knocks at his door, he could either use his computer or an active RFID tag to remotely open the door and thus avoid getting up from his seat.
      
      2. *Bank Teller's Cabin*
      	A bank teller's cabin often has huge amounts of cash stacked away in drawers for day-to-day transactions. There occurs many instances when he will have to leave his cabin leaving the cash and other documents unattended. Though he normally locks the cabin and leave, there is a risk that he could forget latching the door. Using a secure door access control system, he can doubly be sure that the cash and documents remain secure in his cabin.
      
      3. *Locker room in a Bank*
      	A locker room has a safe which is used to secure the valuables of the bank's clients. This room normally left open during the working hours can be extra secured using a door access control device. 
      
      4. *Post Offices*
      	Similar to banks, post offices will also need door control devices for ensuring security from thefts.
      
      5. *Control Rooms of Factories and Industries which are vulnerable to sabotage*
      	Control rooms with critical and sensitive instrumentation panels are high risk areas and need protection from possible sabotage and inexperienced hands. Door Access Control devices fixed on see-through glass doors can easily provide the needed security. 
      
      6. *Rooms of senior officials of Government Institutions and Public Sector Companies*
      	Officials of Govt Departments and Public sector Companies who handle critical files and documents may want their room securely locked in their absense. They may also want to avoid people from unnecessarily entering their rooms and disturbing them. A stand-alone door acccess control device like Safelock would be the right solution for them.
      
      7. *Critical departments in Industries and Govt Institutions like Accounts, Purchase etc*
      	Lots of important and confidential files are handled in such departments. These sections will surely benefit by using a door access control device. 
      
      8. *Sample or Specimen Storage Rooms of Diagnostic Clinics*
      	Unscrupulous elements can easily tamper with diagnostic samples at clinics. A door access control enabled specimen room greatly reduces its risk.
      
      9. *Infertility Clinics*
      	Like in Diagnostics ceneters, infertility clinics can have their integrity more established if they could have a 
      separate specimen room having a door access system in place.
      
      10. *Research Institutions*
      	Research Institutions can store the various specimens they use in access control enabled specimen rooms and thus keep the dishonest people at bay.
      
      11. *Special Purpose Rooms of Hostipals or Doctors' Private Rooms which do not want or require to be connected to a centrally 
      controlled access system* 
      	It may happen that there are sections or rooms in hospitals which do not require a centrally monitored access control system. For example, they won't be wanting an attendance tracking system or anything that fiddle with the confidentiality or privacy of the purpose. What they require will be restricted entry only to prevent possible thefts or sabotage. Such cases 
      can be isolated and a standlone door access control solution applied to them.
      
      12. *Media Offices and Labs*
      	Newspaper and TV media offices handle lots of confidential news items during their day-to-day dealings. Security options for such customers can be explored.
      
      13. *Small-time businesses which require some sort of security for their wares or cash*
      	They include jewellery shops, hotels, wholesale dealers and the like.
      
      14. *Educational institutions*
      	Higher Educational institutions nowadays have costly equipments and computers in their labs. Door access control systems are essential to ensure the safety of such high cost items from thefts.
      
      15. *Lawyers' offices*
      	Lawyers generally handle confidential papers and files. They could protect these sensitive documents by having a door 
      access control device on their room doors.

      Also, look at this webpage from Raviraj tech. They have the solution for inward going door. They have bracket on the door to project out. While the electromagnet stays on the frame.

    Namah Shivaya Pavithra,
    
    Kindly log the changes you have made to the existing Asset Tracking System in basecamp.
    
    Note down unresolved issues, if any.
    
    Also note down any further enhancements you think can be made to the system. We can probably make them at a later date.
    
    Regards

      Pavithra,good work so far!
      
      Please take a look at the comments below and make changes for them.
      
      
      1)In Purchse Order entry screen, PO number not getting incremented automatically
      
      2)In User registration, User id should be an editable field.
      
      3)Currently, users can be assigned to projects with a date higher than current date, which needs to be corrected.
      
      4)In Asset Issue form, at 12:30 AM today, the issue date was still showing as 18/12/2006 and not 19/12/2006. Please check if there is any problem here.
      
      5)In Asset registration, for asset type "accessory" the barcode,mfr serial no. & mfr. name should not be a mandatory field.
      
      6)In asset issue form, presently we can enter only the bar code or the asset id and the rest of the details pop up automatically. This would be correct for assets which are of type "main" and which have bar codes. We will need to make provision for issuing an asset without a barcode and which can be classified as "accessory", 
      For that,Asset Type can be a drop down along with the user and project id.
      Once main is selected, the user can enter the barcode or the asset id,that would fetch the rest of the details.
      
      If accessory is selected, the user should be able to enter assetname. There could be a search icon next to the asset name text box. Example, if I need to issue a Logitech mouse which is an accessory asset, then I might just enter "logitech" and then click the search icon next to the assetname textbox. It would open up another page which would have listings like logitech mouse, logitech keyboard etc. All these would be accessory assets.I can then select one of them. The barcodes, mfr serial no.,mfr name are all optional in case of barcodes.
      All the search results must be case insensitive.

      main points of discussion:
             File names of both xml and bxml files should be passed as command line arguments.
             The characters having ASCII value greater than 128 are skipped.(UTF-8,ANSI) 
             The token-Tag mapping should be changed to continuous numbers within the range.
             The range of token for elements attributes and attribute values are to be commented at the starting of the header file.
      
      After discussion :
             Did the coding 
             -for taking file names as command line arguments.
             -for skipping the character values greater than 128.
      Verified the results.

      Could you also a set of functions (in a separate source module) that allows us to programmatically build the bxml document in memory.  Typically, this is done using DOM APIs.  However, ours need not follow DOM standard since we need a very lightweight library.
      
      The source module can be named 'bxml.c' that has following public functions:
      
      # bxml_start_doc(buf, &pos, bufsz)
      # bxml_start_element(buf, &pos, bufsz, char *element_name, int flags)
      # bxml_add_attribute(buf, &pos, bufsz, char *attribute_name, char *attribute_value)
      # bxml_add_pcdata(buf, &pos, bufsz, char *pcdata)
      # bxml_end_element(buf, &pos, bufsz);
      # bxml_end_doc(buf, &pos, bufsz)
      
      The 'flags' can be used to specify whether the element is empty, has attributes etc.
      For instance, to create a binary xml document:
      <pre>
      <test> <abc attr="value">some text</abc</test>
      </pre>
      
      we would use:
      <pre>
      #define BUFSZ 128
      
      char *buf = (char *)malloc(BUFSZ)
      int pos =0;
      
      bxml_start_doc(buf, &pos, BUFSZ);
      bxml_start_element(buf, &pos, BUFSZ, "test", 0);
      bxml_start_element(buf, &pos, BUFSZ, "abc", ELEM_HAS_ATTR);
      bxml_add_attribute(buf, &pos, BUFSZ, "attr", "value");
      bxml_end_element(buf, &pos, BUFSZ);
      bxml_end_element(buf, &pos, BUFSZ);
      bxml_end_doc(buf, &pos, BUFSZ);
      </pre>
      
      I hope the general idea is clear - you may modify the API appropriately, during the development.

      Did coding for the above functions.
      String table ,litteral tokens and error callback has to be done.

      For string table usage  I wrote a function  
      
      bxml_add_stringtable(buf,&pos,BUFZ,int no_strings,..);
      
      To add so many strings to string table this function is used just after bxml_start_doc. 
      In this case we have to give all tags which are not defined previously, through this function before starting any element. That is no tags can be added to the stringtable after  bxml_start_element is called.
      
      
      Example
      bxml_start_doc(buff,&pos,BUFSZ);
      		bxml_add_string_table(buff,&pos,BUFSZ,3,"wml","field","book");		bxml_start_element(buff,&pos,BUFSZ,"wml",ATTR_CONT);	bxml_add_attribute(buff,&pos,BUFSZ,"NAME","abc");	bxml_start_element(buff,&pos,BUFSZ,"field",CONT);	bxml_add_pcdata(buff,&pos,BUFSZ,"Hello");
      
      Kindly give me valuable comments on this.

    h1. Cyber Security Centre (Software)
    
    h2. Problem Domain
    # Authentication
    # File security: access and encryption
    # Firewalls and network security
    # Web session: ssl certificates; session keys
    # Amtria VPN open source integration
    
    h2. System Features
    # Modularity: browser plugins; framework plugins
    # Multi-tiered: lightweight through heavy-duty
    # Passwords and access-control-lists (ACLs) for
    ** Data
    ** Functions (*Roles* ^1^)
    
    	
    h2. Specificality
    # a security layer could be as specific as a MySQL stored procdure or as general as a user authentication layer that only verifies a password
    ** this could be made more system specific by returning *_Role_* information
    	
    	
    ^1^ *Roles* play a critical part in the system definition; individuals known to the system have one or more roles.  Roles may even be hierarchical, orthogonal, or even conflicting; resolution of role conflicts must be inherent in the design.
    	
    The design of the Cyber Security System should be multi-phased.
    
    First phase will be overall system design, including identification of domains to be addressed, roles to be assumed.  Use cases may be the best place to begin: what problems are we trying to solve and for whom under what conditions.
    
    For instance: We have a group of users that need access to a particular software system.  What are the roles can be identified?  Administrative, updating user, data creating user, report reading user.  Here the administrative user is ambiguous.  In detailed design, this would be broken down into specific function.  In phase one it is necessary only to understand what "Administrative" means in this particular concept.  Is the administrative role one in which parameters of the security layer itself can be modified? or is restricted to administration of the software system itself.  E.g., if we talking about the Hospital Information System, an administrative role could be authorizing new users; changing user roles; changing data backup scripts and so on.
