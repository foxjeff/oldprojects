My humble prostration before AMMA, Mata Amritanandamayi Devi

Om Amriteshwariyai Namah

Why is there such a thing as intellectual property?  How does such a concept come to exist.

The Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property] says this about the reason for intellectual property (IP from here onwards):

The basic public policy rationale for the protection of intellectual property is that IP laws facilitate and encourage the pursuit and disclosure of innovation into the public domain for the common good, by granting authors and inventors exclusive rights to exploit their works and invention for a limited period.

The idea being the protection of rights for a limited period so the property holder has an opportunity to profit from these exclusive rights.

Can profit be gained without these protections?
Is anyone harmed by these protections?
How much time, money, effort is expended securing and defending IP rights?
What is the effect of the atmosphere of fear and paranoia created by enforcing these protections.
How can we justify using "stolen (operating systems, application software, books, etc.)" property ourselves in the creation of IP and then ask for protection by the same laws we have already violated?
