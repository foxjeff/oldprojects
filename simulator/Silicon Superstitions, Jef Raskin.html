<br><span class="content"><b><i>by Jef Raskin, Consultant</i></b></span>
<h5>When we don't understand a process, we fall into magical thinking about results.</h5><p>
We live in a technological age.
Even most individuals on this planet who do not have TV or cellular
telephones know about such gadgets of technology.
They are artifacts made by us and for us.
You'd think, therefore, that it would be part of our common heritage to
understand them.
Their insides are open to inspection, their designers generally
understand the principles behind them, and it is possible to
communicate this knowledge&#8212;even though the "theory of operation"
sections of manuals, once prevalent, seem no longer to be included.
Perhaps that's not surprising considering that manuals themselves are
disappearing, leaving behind glowing Help screens that too often are
just reference material for the cognoscenti rather than guides for the
perplexed.
</p>

<p>This loss of information is unfortunate, as any activity involving
the exact same actions can have different results&#8212;that is, wherever
there's "random reinforcement" (as the psychologists say) is fallow
ground in which superstitions rapidly grow.
Fishing is a good example.
When out angling for rock fish, you generally use the same lure as
everybody else.
There is not much technique to it, so the number of fish you catch is
proportional to the time your lure is in the water.
Those who spend time fiddling with the equipment beforehand catch fewer
fish.
It's a mathematical certainty.
I choose my equipment with one aim in mind: Eliminate hassle.
So while my fishing companions use fancy reels and fight the occasional
tangle, I use the closed-cap kind you give to youngsters because they
seldom foul.
On every trip I have fished to the limit as fast or faster than anybody
else has on the boat.
They don't laugh at my "primitive" equipment anymore, but they do ask
me if there's some special stuff I rub onto my lures to get the fish to
bite or if I have some other "secret."
They don't believe the true explanation, which I am happy to share.
It's too simple, and there's no "secret" stuff or device behind my
success.
</p>

<p>
In fact, people love mysteries and myths so much that they create them when an explanation seems too simple or straightforward.
"Why is Windows so hard to use?" I am asked.
</p>

<p>"Because it was designed badly in the first place and has grown by
repeatedly being patched and adjusted rather than being developed from
the ground up."
</p>

<p>"But, "say the inquisitive, "there must be more to it," thinking
that some deep problems inherent to computers force the outward
complexity.
The only forces involved are what Microsoft mistakenly thinks the
market wants&#8212;and inertia.
</p>

<p>In particular, superstitions grow rampant when testing is
subjective, difficult, and (usually) not performed at all.
There is a purely magical belief in the idea that you can hear the
difference between different brands of audio cables, for example.
You can buy a simple one-meter audio cable with gold-plated RCA
connectors at both ends for a few bucks, or you can buy one with
"time-correct windings" that the manufacturer claims will "provide
accurate phase and amplitude signal response for full, natural music
reproduction."
Price? $40.
Or, if you are especially insecure, purchase a one-meter cable that has
"3-Way Bandwidth Balanced® construction for smoother, more accurate
sound" for a mere $100 from Monster Cable
(http://www.monstercable.com).
I've had the fun of testing if people could tell the difference&#8212;they
couldn't.
At audible frequencies small differences in capacitance, inductance,
and resistance in a cable will make no audible difference, and there
are no significant differences in the pertinent electrical parameters
among popular brands.
One ad, also from Monster Cable, says, "Choosing the right cables can
be a daunting task" (especially if you read the ad copy) and it
explains that "Underbuying is all too common."
This last claim is true, as far as the marketing department is
concerned.
</p>

<p>I e-mailed Monster Cable and challenged the company to conduct a
simple test with its choice of equipment and listeners.
My proposed setup was simple: a CD player, an audio cable to a power
amplifier, and a set of speakers.
All I would do is change the cables between the CD player and the power
amplifier, flipping a coin to determine which cable I'd attach for the
next test.
All the listeners had to do was to identify which was the inexpensive
Radio Shack cable and which was the Monster cable.
I would videotape the experiment so that a viewer could see what cable
I was using and hear what the listener(s) said.
</p>

<p>
We had a friendly exchange of e-mails, but when I proposed this experiment, I got no further replies.
It seems to me that if there were a real difference, the company had nothing to fear.
</p>

<p>All testimonials and most magazine reviews are based on situations
in which the reviewer knew what audio equipment was being used.
Owners and magazine reviewers have a vested interest; the former needs
to justify the money spent, the latter needs to preserve ad revenue.
</p>

<p>One claim that is obviously false without requiring testing involves
weighted rims that are sold for audio CDs.
The makers claim that the added mass will help the CD spin at an
unvarying rate.
This is true.
People who know a bit of physics are aware that a greater mass is
accelerated less by a given force, so any disturbing force will have
less effect on the rate of spin of a heavier disk.
The makers also claim that this will make the CD sound better with less
"wow" or "flutter," which on tape recordings or vinyl records was the
result of uneven motion of the recording medium.
The claim for better sound is false and relies on the ignorance of
owners of CD players.
Ignorance is superstition's guide.
</p>

<p>What the suckers who purchase these rims don't know is that the CD
player reads ahead of where it is playing and stores the musical data
in semiconductor memory, which acts as a buffer.
The information in memory is clocked out by an unvarying crystal
oscillator.
Any unevenness in the speed of rotation of the CD (so long as it is
sending data to the buffer faster than it's being played) is simply
irrelevant to the sound.
In fact, this was one of the points of genius in the design of the CD
player, making the quality of sound independent of the mechanical
quality of the rotation of the media.
With the introduction of CDs, flutter and wow instantly vanished to
inaudible levels.
Weighted rims are simply irrelevant.
</p>

<p>When I was a graduate student I did the simplest possible
experiment.
I placed a pair of amplifiers on a table: one fancy and expensive, and
the other plain and cheap.
Both had wires that ran to a switch box.
The switch was clearly labeled as to which amp corresponded to which
position.
Subjects were allowed as much time as they wanted; they operated the
switch themselves, and all they had to do was to report in which
position of the switch the system sounded better.
All but a few reported that they could tell the difference, and almost
all preferred the more expensive unit.
One person said that as far as he was concerned, the switch "wasn't
doing anything at all."
That person was right: I was using only one amplifier and the switch
was not connected to anything.
The results were statistically significant, and showed that people can
fool themselves with alarming ease.
</p>

<p>Computer systems exhibit all the behaviors best suited to create
superstitious responses.
You will try something, it won't work, so you try it again&#8212;the exact
same way&#8212;and this time it works, or not.
That's random reinforcement.
The effectiveness of many programming and management practices thus are
not measurable.
Most of the principles of "extreme programming," for example, seem
reasonable to me, and I was using many of them long before they had
acquired their present absurd name.
The people who promulgate the idea, however, are also those who created
the paradigm.
Most reported results aren't even single-blind, much less double-blind.
We rarely understand, in any detail, the processes going on behind the
tasks we do with computers.
We're using megabytes of code written by others, code that is
indifferently documented and inadequately tested, and which is being
used in ways and in combinations unforeseen by its creators.
</p>

<p>No wonder we tend to act as if computers are run by magic.
Many of us (including me) use the exact sequence of operations for a
task because it worked once and we don't dare to vary it (even when
somebody suggests a different method).
The now obsolescent SCSI (small computer system interface) bus was that
way, too: Some configurations worked, whereas others that seemed to
obey the rules on cable length, termination, and device addresses did
not.
Once we had a setup working, we wouldn't change it; it was as if we had
achieved some heavenly arrangement.
</p>

<p>I invite readers to share examples of superstitious behavior in the
technological world with me.
Meanwhile, be a skeptic: Ask yourself if what you're doing is based on
fact, on observation, on a sound footing, or if there is something
dodgy about it&#8212;if there's a touch of superstition in your interaction
with technology.
